# Medicine Recommendation System

## Why I built this

I noticed that a lot of people around me, especially in smaller towns, don't really know what medicine to take when they fall sick. They either guess, ask a random person, or just ignore it. I thought — what if there was something simple that takes your symptoms and at least points you in the right direction? So I built this. It's not perfect, but it works better than I expected.


## What it does

- Asks for your name and age
- Shows a numbered list of symptoms
- You pick the ones you have by entering their numbers
- The ML model predicts the most likely disease
- Shows recommended medicines and precautions
- Displays a confidence chart so you know how sure the AI is
- Option to save the full result as a text file


## AIML Concepts Used

- Supervised Learning
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Feature Engineering (binary symptom vectors)
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Prediction with probability/confidence scoring


## How to run it

Make sure Python is installed on your system first.

**Step 1 — Clone or download the project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/medicine-recommender
cd medicine-recommender
```

**Step 2 — Install the required libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3 — Train the model (do this once)**
```bash
python train_model.py
```

This creates two files — model.pkl and symptoms_list.pkl. You only need to do this once.

**Step 4 — Run the app**
```bash
python app.py
```

Just open the folder in VS Code, open a new terminal, and type `python app.py` — it'll start immediately and ask for your name.

## ML Models Compared

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree | ~95% |
| Random Forest | ~97.56% |

Random Forest performed better so that's the one that gets saved and used automatically.



## Tech used

- Python 3
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pickle



## Future Improvements

- Web or mobile interface
- Larger dataset with more diseases
- Voice input for symptoms
- Multi-language support



## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand how ML models are trained, compared and deployed in a real use case. I learnt how to convert raw data into binary feature vectors, evaluate two different classifiers, and build a complete CLI application around an ML model.
